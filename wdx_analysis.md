# Factors effecting the environment and contributing to climate change.
In the 21st century the words climate change, pollution, global warming are not new to us and something which we all know is happening and are aware of. If the trend keeps continuing the effects could be disastrous. Thankfully there is enough awarness about the issue and necessary steps are being taken to reduce the impact on the environment. Let us have a brief look at the major factors effecting the environment.
## CO2 Emissions.
Carbon dioxide is a colorless, naturally occurring gas that is released after people and animals inhale oxygen. It is a greenhouse gas, meaning it absorbs and releases thermal radiation which in turn creates the “greenhouse effect”. In addition to other greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is also a major contributor to the ability of the Earth to maintain a habitable temperature. Without carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to live on. However, while carbon dioxide alone is not a harmful gas, the abundance of it is what causes climate change. The increased use of electricity, transportation, and deforestation in human society have resulted in the increased emissions of carbon dioxide. This in turn has seen a rise in earth’s temperature.

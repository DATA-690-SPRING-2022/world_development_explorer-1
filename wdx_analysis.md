# Factors effecting the environment and contributing to climate change.
In the 21st century the words climate change, pollution, global warming are not new to us and something which we all know is happening and are aware of. If the trend keeps continuing the effects could be disastrous. Thankfully there is enough awarness about the issue and necessary steps are being taken to reduce the impact on the environment. Let us have a brief look at the major factors effecting the environment.

Majorly I would like to explore the CO2 emissions, the forest cover and the urban area in the top 3 most populous countries in the world. I think these factors have an impact on the environment and I would like to find out if there is a relation between the three factors. First let us look at each factor individually and try to find out if there is a relation between the three.

To answer my questions above I would like to use THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT EXPLORER a website which has all the data that I need, another good thing about the website is that we can just select what indicators/data we need and generate all different kinds of graphs right on the website, which is pretty convinient to find patterns. I will link the website below for reference. 

## CO2 Emissions.
- Carbon dioxide is a colorless, naturally occurring gas that is released after people and animals inhale oxygen. It is a greenhouse gas, meaning it absorbs and releases thermal radiation which in turn creates the “greenhouse effect”. 
- In addition to other greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is also a major contributor to the ability of the Earth to maintain a habitable temperature. Without carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to live on. However, while carbon dioxide alone is not a harmful gas, the abundance of it is what causes climate change. The increased use of electricity, transportation, and deforestation in human society have resulted in the increased emissions of carbon dioxide. This in turn has seen a rise in earth’s temperature.

After looking at the above graph, it is common to infer that population could be the reason for higher CO2 emissions, but is population the only reason.? Let us find out.

Clearly population is not the only reason for higher CO2 emissions. 

## Forest cover
- Forests are vital to life on Earth. They purify the air we breathe, filter the water we drink, prevent erosion, and act as an important buffer against climate change. When it comes to fighting global warming, trees have emerged as one of the most popular weapons. With nations making little progress controlling their carbon emissions, many governments and advocates have advanced plans to plant vast numbers of trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in an attempt to slow climate change.

- If tree-planting programmes work as advertised, they could buy precious time for the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and replace them with cleaner sources of energy. One widely cited 2017 study1 estimated that forests and other ecosystems could provide more than one-third of the total CO2 reductions required to keep global warming below 2 °C through to 2030.

The above graph is interesting to note, I always thought lower forest cover meant more CO2 emissions but maybe that is not always true, what could be the other factors contributing to it.

The United States have a pretty impressive forest cover and doing an impressive job at protecting its forests, China is improving its forest cover but India needs to catch up.

## Urban land area

- Urban land expansion—the process of creating the built environment to house urban populations and their activities—is one of the fundamental aspects of urbanization. Urban land expansion modifies habitats, biogeochemistry, hydrology, land cover, and surface energy balance.
- In most parts of the world, urban land is expanding faster than urban populations, whereas urban populations are expected to almost double from 2.6 billion in 2000 to 5 billion in 2030, urban areas are forecast to triple between 2000 and 2030. 
- A defining characteristic of contemporary urbanization is the rise of megaurban regions (MURs): the merging of multiple urban areas into a contiguous and continuous urban fabric. These MURs differ from megacities with populations of 10 million or more in two important and fundamental ways: administratively, they consist of multiple contiguous entities with discrete governance structures; biophysically, they are a single continuous urban area whose absolute spatial size creates challenges for urban, land, and transport governance. The rate and magnitude of urban land expansion are influenced by many macro factors, including income, economic development, and population growth, as well as a number of local and regional factors such as land use policies, the informal economy, capital flows, and transportation costs.

Let us first compare the urban land area.

Urban land area through time.

The urban land area in different countries through time is almost flat which is interesting to notice as urban development always seems to be on the rise.

Comparing the relation between CO2 emissions and forest cover.

Comparing the relation between CO2 emissions and urban area(For the year 2010 as the latest data available for urban area is until 2010).

From the above data some patterns and findings were unexpected and interesting, and made me realise that assumptions are sometimes wrong when compared with real-time data. These are my initial findings and analysis of the factors effecting the environment.
